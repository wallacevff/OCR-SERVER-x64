% Example for using .gen_ordered to make a Type 3 Halftone (threshold) array
% Note the default HResolution and VResolution are the device resolution.

% If the DITHERLPI is defined, it will determine the Lines-per-inch of the
% screen (Frequency), and if DITHERANGLE is defined, it will be used as
% the Angle for the screen. Otherwise, the LPI and ANGLE of the currentscreen
% will be used as the default.

% Refer to doc/Language.htm for description of the .genordered parameters
% and the defaults.
