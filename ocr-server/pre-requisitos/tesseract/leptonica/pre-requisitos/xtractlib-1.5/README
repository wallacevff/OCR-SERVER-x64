tar -xvf xtractlib-1.5.tar


0.  The src and prog directories contain a very small subset of leptonlib,
    which can be used to build a C prototype extraction program (xtractprotos).
    
1.  First, to compile the tiny library, use 'make' in the src directory.
    Then, to build xtractprotos, use 'make' in the prog directory.
    It is also possible to make a debug version, as well as one that
    builds and uses shared libraries.  If you want to use shared
    libraries, you need to add the location of the shared
    libraries to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  See the Makefile for other
    details.

2.  When you compile, object code is put into a tree with root
    at the place where you un-tar'd.  If you want to change the
    location of the generated object code, change the ROOT_DIR
    variable in the Makefiles.

3.  The prototypes necessary to build this small library are in allheaders.h.
    After you have built xtractprotos, you can generate this file, with
      make allheaders

Version log
=============

1 Oct 06.  Version 1.1
     Initial version

29 Dec 07.  Version 1.2
     C++ rules for prototypes require giving the full signature
     for function prototypes when used as arguments to a function,
     rather than simply void *.  So in searchForProtoSignature(),
     we've added a function that looks for a matching right parenthesis
     in the argument list, rather than the first right parenthesis.

12 May 08.  Version 1.3
     Handle empty files properly (we now have these: they're stubs).

12 Jul 09.  Version 1.4
     Allow optional string prepended to each prototype.  This was required
     so that tesseact can properly bundle leptonica and build a
     leptonica dll.

15 May 11.  Version 1.5
     Allow option of putting prototypes inline within allheaders.h.
     Had to add two more src files: bytearray.c, numabasic.c.  Both of
      these are used in the parsing.
